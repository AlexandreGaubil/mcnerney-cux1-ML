# mcnerney-cux1-ML
_CUX1 ML algorithm for [McNerney Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/mcnerneylab/) @ UChicago_

# About

This algorithm is based on [Weinreb's 2020 paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw3381) _Lineage tracing on transcriptional landscapes links state to fate during differentiation_ dataset. We reproduced the data analysis they performed and implemented further methods for determining cell fate based on Cux1 related genes.


# Setup

## Data organisation

The `data/` folder contains any and all data files. It has three subfolders:
 - `input/`, to place data files that come from Weinreb (2020) ;
 - `cache/`, to place data files generated by the `R` script that are used by the `R` script later on ;
 - `output/`, to place data files generated by the `R` script that are used by the python files or are a final output.

The `input/` folder should contain the following files:
 - `clone_matrix.mtx`
 - `metadata.txt`
 - `normed_counts.mtx`

The `cache/input_for_seurat/` folder should contain the following file:
 - `features.tsv.gz`
