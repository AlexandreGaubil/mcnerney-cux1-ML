## Data organisation

The `data/` folder contains any and all data files. It has three subfolders:
 - `input/`, to place data files that come from Weinreb (2020) ;
 - `cache/`, to place data files generated by the `R` script that are used by the `R` script later on ;
 - `output/`, to place data files generated by the `R` script that are used by the python files or are a final output.

The `input/` folder should contain the following files:
 - `clone_matrix.mtx`
 - `metadata.txt`
 - `normed_counts.mtx`

The `cache/input_for_seurat/` folder should contain the following file:
 - `features.tsv.gz`
