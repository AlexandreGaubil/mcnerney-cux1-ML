## Data files

The data files are too big to track them on git. Instead, ensure you have your files in the `data/` folder on the main working directory. They should be named as follows:

- `cell_barcodes.txt`
- `clone_matrix.mtx`
- `gene_names.txt`
- `library_names.txt`
- `metadata.txt`
- `normed_counts.mtx`
